    <h2>Under the Aurora</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Two small figures trudged through the treacherous terrain of snow and ice, bundled in coats, gloves, and caps that covered everything but their eyes. The elder boy, determined and resolute, began pounding the ice with his stick. Satisfied, he plunged his pick into the icy layer, creating a hole. The younger one carefully threaded his line with bait, their gazes fixed on the frigid water below. Snowflakes danced in the air.
        <br>
        "Have you ever looked directly at the sun?" the younger boy muffled his voice, breaking the humming silence.
        <br>
        "No," replied the elder, caution in his tone. "They say it could blind your eyes. Why do you ask?"
        <br>
        "I can't remember what the sun is supposed to look like," he solemnly confessed.
        <br>
        The elder paused, reflecting on the passage of time. "Yes, you're too young to remember. Has it truly been that long?"
        <br>
        "Right now, I just want to see the sun, even if it blinds me," the younger boy declared.
        <br>
        The elder gently tapped his double-gloved hand against the younger's, whispering, "Me too... me too." He removed his mask, exhaling a sigh that crystallized into a misty haze. "Hopefully, we can catch something for dinner today. I'm famished."
        <br>
        Suddenly, the elder noticed a silhouette emerging from the outskirts of their village, catching his peripheral vision. Rising from his seat, he called out, "Who goes there?" The younger boy turned to look as well, as the elder grabbed his saw and approached the figure. He instructed the younger one, "Wait here!"
        <br>
        Unwilling to be left behind, the younger boy abandoned his fishing line, but the snow and wind obstructed his vision. He struggled to keep up, bumping into the elder. "Hey! What's the matter?" he exclaimed.
        <br>
        Before them stood not a hidden silhouette but a man¡ªhis body covered in a black, shimmering surface resembling obsidian. It was as if the man was made of the very substance. With a powerful stomp, the man's foot creacked the ice sheet, emitting a high-pitched groan. "Run," the elder whispered urgently. "RUN!" He seized the younger boy's hand and they fled together, their footsteps echoing in the chilling air.
